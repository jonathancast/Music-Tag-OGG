NAME
    Music::Tag::OGG - Plugin module for Music::Tag to get information from
    ogg-vorbis headers.

SYNOPSIS
            use Music::Tag

            my $filename = "/var/lib/music/artist/album/track.ogg";

            my $info = Music::Tag->new($filename, { quiet => 1 }, "OGG");

            $info->get_info();
   
            print "Artist is ", $info->artist;

DESCRIPTION
    Music::Tag::OGG is used to read ogg-vorbis header information. It uses
    Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl. I have gone back and forth with using
    this and Ogg::Vorbis::Header. Finally I have settled on
    Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl, because the autoload for
    Ogg::Vorbis::Header was a pain to work with.

    To write Ogg::Vorbis headers I use the program vorbiscomment. It looks
    for this in the path, or in the option variable "vorbiscomment." This
    tool is available from http://www.xiph.org/ as part of the vorbis-tools
    distribution.

    Music::Tag::Ogg objects must be created by Music::Tag.

REQUIRED DATA VALUES
    No values are required (except filename, which is usually provided on
    object creation).

SET DATA VALUES
    title, track, totaltracks, artist, album, comment, releasedate, genre,
    disc, label
        Uses standard tags for these

    asin
        Uses custom tag "ASIN" for this

    mb_artistid, mb_albumid, mb_trackid, mip_puid, countrycode, albumartist
        Uses MusicBrainz recommended tags for these.

METHODS
    default_options
        Returns the default options for the plugin.

    set_tag
        Save info from object back to ogg vorbis file using vorbiscomment

    get_tag
        Get info for object from ogg vorbis header using
        Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl

    close
        Close the file and destroy the Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl object.

    ogg Returns the Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl object.

OPTIONS
    vorbiscomment
        The full path to the vorbiscomment program. Defaults to just
        "vorbiscomment", which assumes that vorbiscomment is in your path.

BUGS
    No known additional bugs provided by this Module
