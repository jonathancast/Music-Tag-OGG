DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Music::Tag
   Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl

NOTE ON WRITE SUPPORT

I have had trouble with Ogg::Vorbis::Header.  As such, I have stoped using it. 
I now use OGG::Vorbis::PurePerl. This module is also buggy, and doesn't have
write support.  To overcome this limitation, for now, I am using the
vorbiscomment program that is part of the vorbis-tools package from xiph.org.

I am planning on adding write support to Ogg::Vorbis::PurePerl someday.

TEST FILES

Are based on the sample file for Audio::M4P.  For testing only.
